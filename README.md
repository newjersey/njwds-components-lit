# NJWDS Web Components

## Key concepts

- `Yarn`: For this tutorial we will use` yarn` since personally it solves dependencies better, it has more functions that `npm` does not have and is used in other projects. The commands are very similar, don't worry if you haven't seen `yarn` yet.
- [`lit-plugin`] (https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=runem.lit-plugin) Is a syntax highlighting, type checking and code completion for `lit` in VS Code.
- [`Vite`] (https://vitejs.dev/) is a build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects.

## ðŸš€ Dev setup

Note: This repo is forked from the [Lit Simple Starter Kit](https://github.com/litelement-dev/lit-simple-starter-kit)

### Requirements

- Have `npm` or` yarn` installed

2. `yarn install`
3. `yarn build` - compiles TS files into JS files in `dist/` folder
